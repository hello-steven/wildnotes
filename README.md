# Wild Notes

Music discovery application. This project was born out of a Milwaukee hackathon that was sponsored by 88.9FM. The goal was to create a connection with communities and their local/independent artists. Wild Notes is currently a proof of concept for a web application that hosts geolocked content. Music fans unlock special content once within range of a certain longitute and latitude. The location adds a layer of depth to the content discovery experience and gets people out into their local communities.
